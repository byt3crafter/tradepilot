Update the P/L logic so it works for both buys and sells. Use a directionFactor of +1 for BUY/LONG and -1 for SELL/SHORT, and always compute P/L as (exitPrice - entryPrice) * directionFactor. Wrap it in a single helper like computePL(trade, currentPrice?) that returns grossPL and netPL, and call that everywhere we show P/L (history table, expanded row, live trades, stats). The “Result” field should be derived from netPL (>0 win, <0 loss, =0 breakeven) instead of hardcoded logic.
